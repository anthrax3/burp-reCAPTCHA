# burp-reCAPTCHA
Burp Suite Extension to solve reCAPTCHAs manually.

The Extension is based on [idontplaydarts.com's reCAPTCHA Extension](https://www.idontplaydarts.com/2012/01/extending-burp-suite-to-solve-recaptcha/).

## Idea 
The idea is to modify the code to build a manual version. Everytime a reCAPTCHA is deteced a dialog is displayed to solve the CAPTCHA. This should enhance the fuzzing and semi-automatic pentesting.
